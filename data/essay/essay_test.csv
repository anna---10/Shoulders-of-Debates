0	B	The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide
0	I	While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries , I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations .
0	B	Firstly , it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations
0	I	Take Thailand for example , in the Vietnam War , many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities , these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded , even illegally involved in under - age prostitutes to maximize their profits
0	I	This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism
0	I	Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries .
0	B	Secondly , there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals
0	I	As the Australia ’ s Great Barrier Reef has shown , the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder , namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat ’ s anchors , dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions
0	I	For this reason , many marine lives have been endangered , in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species
0	I	Thus , it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments .
0	B	To conclude , I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments
0	I	If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values , they will be destroyed in the near future .
1	B	It is every student ' s desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment
1	I	While some students study and live overseas to achieve this , some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas
1	I	In my opinion , one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons .
1	B	First , studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures
1	I	Compared to the peers studying in the home country , it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself / herself into new environments and situations in life .
1	B	Second , living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet
1	I	One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness , living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life
1	I	Moreover , the one will learn living without depending on anyone else .
1	B	Also , employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills
1	I	Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market
1	I	Therefore , one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his / her peers .
1	B	In conclusion , there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas
1	I	However , living and studying overseas gives the individual a new perspective on the subject that is studied or in general life .
2	B	Studying abroad is one very common thing that students do , and they have different reasons for that
2	I	I believe that studying abroad has many advantages
2	I	Students gain a lot out of the experience personally , academically , and culturally .
2	B	First of all , students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country
2	I	Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one ' s character
2	I	For example , students might face many challenges in the host country
2	I	Therefore , they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter
2	I	Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self - independence .
2	B	One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies
2	I	For example , they will get exposed to a different educational system
2	I	They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country .
2	B	Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience
2	I	While living in a foreign country , students can learn a lot about the culture of that country
2	I	Furthermore , they can meet different people of the country
2	I	They can learn about their way of thinking , their customs and traditions , and way of life
2	I	Learning about others ' cultures is so important
2	I	It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world
2	I	It makes us more open , and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts
2	I	Also it educates us about the world we are living in .
2	B	In conclusion , studying abroad does not only have advantages , but also can change us in a very positive way
2	I	It can influence us in different aspects of life .
3	B	Everyday , companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers
3	I	The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising
3	I	However , it is not sufficient in itself
3	I	The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers
3	I	In my opinion , advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons .
3	B	We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements
3	I	Therefore , advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product
3	I	When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised , they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases
3	I	Recently , there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV
3	I	The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot
3	I	As a result of this , the number of that product being sold will increases .
3	B	Also , the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media , the more popular the product becomes
3	I	Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well - known product
3	I	Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product
3	I	When a product is commonly used , it becomes trustworthy for the society , no matter what quality it is
3	I	However , it also has to be affordable for the consumer
3	I	Considering this fact , advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised
3	I	They make the product preferable .
3	B	In conclusion , as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods , high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements .
4	O	The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard - working and productive is by raising their salaries
4	O	In this essay , I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this .
4	B	A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places
4	I	Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss ' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile
4	I	For instance , junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students ' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want
4	I	If the teachers receive higher salaries , they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth , as this is what is happening in Taiwan .
4	B	Nevertheless , I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances
4	I	Take Google for example , the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce
4	I	By doing this , the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured .
4	B	To sum up , I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder - working employees
4	I	Alternatively , providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses .
5	O	With the development of globalization , English became the dominated language in national trade , conference and many important events
5	O	This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public .
5	B	Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people
5	I	First of all , it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly
5	I	In the ancient time , the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas
5	I	Fortunately , the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers
5	I	If we can popularize the use of English , the language hinder will disappear as well
5	I	In addition , English is a beautiful language , which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages
5	I	Learning English can foster people ' s sentiment and nourish their literature and art .
5	B	However , the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less - used languages become extinct
5	I	Even English is a sophisticated language ; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries , which have totally different linguistic system
5	I	It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people ' s daily life , which is influenced by culture , environment as well as religious
5	I	Obviously , these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity .
5	B	Personally , English as an elegant language should be advocated in many fields to expand the global trade and communications
5	I	But , we still need preserve other languages for sake of keeping the linguistic and cultural diversity .
6	B	Computer - a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life
6	I	Ever since Charles Babbage ( know as  Father of computers ) invented computers , its development never had a pause
6	I	The whole world is dependent on computers , without which , the world will go back hundreds of years .
6	B	In the modern world , computers are used everywhere
6	I	Right from flying planes to sending a small document , computers are needed
6	I	They are used in space programs , wars , hospitals , schools and so on
6	I	Computers have made human life more easy , convenient and lightning fast
6	I	For example , in earlier days , if one had to send a message to someone in other country , it used to take months
6	I	But today , it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks
6	I	Computers provide speed , increase efficiency , accuracy , precision , help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it .
6	B	Moreover , future prospects of computers are very bright
6	I	From a computer as big as a room , it has now been minimized to the size of a palm
6	I	Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels
6	I	Research on making computerized drone soldiers ( unmanned computer controlled ) is going on
6	I	There is no end to the evolution of computers .
6	B	However , everything has pros and cons
6	I	Computers have made humans over - dependent
6	I	Virus programs , privacy breach , leak of confidential documents , cyber attacks , identity theft , frauds etc
6	I	are some of its demerits , from a countless list
6	I	Computers expose children to vulgar materials
6	I	They have even invaded mental health of humans , for example , FAD ( Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook )
6	I	Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives
6	I	The recent case of Wikileaks , leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful .
6	B	Nevertheless , with all the mentioned demerits , computers have provided security and sophistication too
6	I	Thus , dependence on computers is not a bad thing
6	I	However , one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things
6	I	Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective
6	I	Human life today can ' t be imagined without computers , so not depending on them is out of question .
7	B	The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media .
7	B	Obviously , violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences
7	I	This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who , lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong , are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable .
7	B	On the other hand , media , such as TV or film , is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government
7	I	It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society
7	I	Violence , as one of the facts in the real world , certainly has to be reported
7	I	However , excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well
7	I	It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen - year - old boy killed all his family members , one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy
7	I	In the real world , we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure .
7	B	We cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present
7	I	What the government should do immediately is to strengthen censorship to control the amount of violence in media
7	I	Otherwise , the violent crime rate will rise continuously and out of control someday .
8	B	Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information
8	I	Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public
8	I	My view is that while some of them are disturbing , we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring .
8	B	First , it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring
8	I	In fact , they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture , good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor .
8	B	Besides , it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies
8	I	In a larger sense , it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country
8	I	A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign , the sales revenue would increase by 40 %, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic .
8	B	That is not to say , however , that advertisements have no downsides
8	I	Of course , the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information , creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies
8	I	Yet , its merits still outweigh these downsides .
8	B	Taken all together , advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth
8	I	We can not deny all of them
8	I	However , if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned , advertisements would be welcomed by more .
9	B	In modern society , people often face many difficulties under great stress
9	I	Therefore , it is necessary for many to find ways to relax
9	I	Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies , such as reading , watching movies , or working in their gardens , I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise , which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions .
9	B	It is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health
9	I	Any kinds of sports , such as jogging , swimming , or playing basketball , can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system
9	I	Moreover , these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body
9	I	The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity
9	I	Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years , which mainly results from insufficient exercises .
9	B	Sports activities can improve mental health as well
9	I	When people exercise , the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine
9	I	This hormone can delight one ' s mind , creating positive feelings
9	I	Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one ' s heavy burdens
9	I	Moreover , rigorous exercise can also hone one ' s will , which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks .
9	B	In a nutshell , many activities can let humans relax
9	I	Nevertheless , I assert that the best way of diminishing stress is by exercises , which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally .
10	B	Children tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen
10	I	When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society , animal - right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned
10	I	I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education .
10	B	There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco - system , which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals
10	I	In contrast , zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff
10	I	Once the animal got sick , professional vet will help them promptly
10	I	Thanks to the considerate care , the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed .
10	B	Additionally , zoos afford a platform to education teenagers , helping to establish eco - friendly behavior towards animals
10	I	In the zoos , even though wild animals are caged , they have capability to walk in a limited area
10	I	When children pay a visit to the zoos , they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals , which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals
10	I	Further , children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers .
10	B	On the other hand , complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard
10	I	It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage
10	I	Also , being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals .
10	B	In order to protect animals , from my perspective , zoos offer a good man - made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals
10	I	What the zoos should do is improvement of the management system and use the income wisely in preserving wild animals better .
11	O	Nowadays , the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers , radio and television has become very prevalent , so it is thought to be a necessary part of today ' s society
11	O	Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this
11	O	Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn .
11	B	First , it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more
11	I	Advertisements are , therefore , very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits
11	I	Also , to consumers , advertising can bring them many benefits
11	I	For example , customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans
11	I	From all of these , it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support .
11	B	However , it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts
11	I	Firstly , a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses , this is generally known as spam , and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people
11	I	Secondly , advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results
11	I	Therefore , advertising is believed by many , a financial burden to businesses .
11	B	In conclusion , after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising , both of the views have strong support , but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad
11	I	Thus , the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported .
12	B	Nowadays living is possible on every place of the world , but still there are some differences among them
12	I	From my point of view big cities can be a good place for bringing up children .
12	B	To begin with , it is undeniable that education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides
12	I	For instance , in my country the best schools , universities and institutes are located in cities , and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children ' s life
12	I	Therefore , it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities .
12	B	What is more , it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities
12	I	Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment
12	I	For example playgrounds , parks , science museums , cinemas etc
12	I	However , in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities
12	I	Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms .
12	B	Finally , in big cities children access to media easily , so they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net
12	I	Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world , therefor they can exchange their knowledge , they can learn different cultures .
12	B	To sum up , although countrysides have some advantages such as fresh air , peace , and etc
12	I	Today ' s children needs somethings to entertain them , and occupy their leisure time in the best way .
13	B	The 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization , which raises people ' s concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not
13	I	From my perspective , a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people .
13	B	It is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation
13	I	As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language , they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade , which can intensify the transnational cooperation
13	I	In contrast , without the availability of the same language , there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations , impeding collaborations between them
13	I	Therefore , a single international language serves an economic purpose .
13	B	Also , a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions
13	I	If people are equipped with a single international language , they can tell each other smoothly about their countries ' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles , which enables people to expand their outlooks , viewing the world in new angles
13	I	For example , when people travel to foreign countries , the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language , helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience .
13	B	In spite of this , the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied
13	I	To be more specific , a single international language may , to some extent , erode the cultural identity of a nation
13	I	This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language , eroding a sense of national belong
13	I	For instance , some Asians are seeking individualism , previously denied by many Asian countries , due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies , which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English .
13	B	Therefore , I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication
13	I	On the other hand , every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage .
14	B	Whenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place , it attracts millions of people all over the world
14	I	As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border , popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely .
14	B	First and foremost , sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results , break records and bring victories to their own countries
14	I	Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events , there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures
14	I	Consequently , sport events with the spirit of healthiness , honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding , friendship and solidarity among nations
14	I	After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition , the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners , which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations .
14	B	Secondly , sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators
14	I	Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete
14	I	The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country
14	I	When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others , many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness
14	I	For instance , when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008 , a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets
14	I	People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags , banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President
14	I	The eager atmosphere lasted many next days
14	I	In fact , some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally
14	I	However , the hooligans only took a minority of people
14	I	Therefore , it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen .
14	B	In conclusion , international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely
14	I	Hence , I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future .
15	B	In many countries , children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions
15	I	Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities
15	I	However , some people think it ' s not a good educational measure
15	I	From my point of view , the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks .
15	B	First of all , children can learn about the hardship of earning money
15	I	When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies , doing housework and keeping shops , they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life
15	I	Therefore , they are likely to understand their parents ' hardship , to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving .
15	B	Secondly , when children take jobs , they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working
15	I	To keep their jobs , children will have to try their best to finish their duties
15	I	For example , if a child works as a shop assistant , he will have to keep an eye on good and products , calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost .
15	B	Some people may argue that children will be more material , neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers
15	I	However , if children get good care and instructions from their parents , they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way .
15	B	In conclusion , if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents ' permission , they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible
15	I	I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children ' s study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children ' s labour .
16	O	Courts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant , except those of the UK and Australia
16	O	Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries .
16	B	Many people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions , which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury
16	I	We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant ' s personality
16	I	Furthermore , past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes , such as kidnapping or a murder .
16	B	Nevertheless , in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience , the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only
16	I	For instance , a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record
16	I	Innocent suspects , eventually , can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions .
16	B	In conclusion , I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant ' s history to the jury , with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict
16	I	Thus , I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia , and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions .
17	B	Over the past few decades , the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization , especially in field of education
17	I	This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students
17	I	Consequently , direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized
17	I	However , the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists
17	I	Personally , I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning .
17	B	First and foremost , the Internet is an adequate source of academic information , which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils
17	I	Nowadays , not only are lectures available online , it is also applicable to find reference e - books as well as multi - aspect documents on the cyberspace
17	I	As such , the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever
17	I	Moreover , with the use of the Internet , distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance
17	I	College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries
17	I	Last but not least , the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying
17	I	While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes , Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query .
17	B	In the near future , the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training , for the enormous benefits that it brings about
17	I	Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously ? This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances .
17	B	Critics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively , for instance internet abuse and black webs
17	I	However , we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students ' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself
17	I	Thus , what we are to do is a change in learners ' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study .
17	B	After analyzing both points of view , I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process
17	I	It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages
17	I	However , it is not just the matter of help or hindrance , it is the way you use the cyberspace
17	I	Be wise and conscious .
18	O	Nowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty - five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy
18	O	Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young , others claim that this is not the case .
18	B	Admittedly , encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty - five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits
18	I	Firstly , fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation
18	I	This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities
18	I	Secondly , having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency
18	I	Compared with aged staffs , younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline .
18	B	However , sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences
18	I	From personal level , it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations
18	I	It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it , disregard the age and physical capacity
18	I	From social perspective , massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government
18	I	For example , sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently .
18	B	In conclusion , even though the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits , it is convincing that it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly .
19	O	It is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems
19	O	Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems
19	O	In the following paragraphs , I intend to discuss both viewpoints .
19	B	Some people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment
19	I	They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment
19	I	If people don ' t use air conditioners , automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us , then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment .
19	B	On the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment
19	I	They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back
19	I	We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart .
19	B	There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot
19	I	One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa
19	I	By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes , we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource
19	I	Furthermore , Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030
19	I	By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun , it could meet the entire world ' s electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions
19	I	If successful , the impact on the world would be monumental
19	I	It would mean energy for schools , hospitals , and homes
19	I	It would mean another industrial revolution .
19	B	To put it in a nutshell , I pen down saying that , technology alone can solve the world ' s environmental problems
19	I	We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place
19	I	It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life .
20	O	With the number of technological advances growing apace , it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future
20	O	This idea may point out to two main directions , both of which present different arguments .
20	B	Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information , which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate
20	I	Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge , ranging from visual to aural stimuli , which make learning an ever enjoyable experience , especially for children .
20	B	On the other hand , critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable , there still remain certain shortcomings
20	I	Much information as the Internet may provide , most of the sources are unjustified by experts
20	I	As a result , information from those sources is subject to question
20	I	Admittedly , the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in - depth explanation as a human teacher can
20	I	Through face - to - face communication , teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore , adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students
20	I	This is where the computer proves to be incompetent .
20	B	In short , although both sides have their equally valid arguments , I am inclined to think that although Internet can be a useful tool for education , at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced .
21	B	There is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance
21	I	However , I still agree that it ' s better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances .
21	B	We can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant
21	I	First , it ' s not easy to make friend with anyone
21	I	I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other
21	I	After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities , for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways
21	I	Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances
21	I	We spend time together but we could never be friend
21	I	So , it ' s much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends .
21	B	Second , close friends can easily understand each others feelings
21	I	Because of the similarity I talked before , acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends
21	I	Moreover , they wouldn ' t even spare time to consider your feelings
21	I	Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time
21	I	Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend
21	I	When my friend is sick , I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible
21	I	If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail , I will try my best to pull him back , but not stand and stare like it ' s not of my business
21	I	And I believe my friend will do the same to me
21	I	In conclusion , a friend is a person you care about .
21	B	To me , friends are the most important people in my life second to my family
21	I	I am the kind of person who has only one or two close friends , and I am fully content that I have such nice friends
21	I	If someone exchange my friends with thousands of acquaintances , I will definitely say NO .
22	B	There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace , and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity
22	I	Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks , while others seem to prefer the opposite position
22	I	After deeply pondering over this issue , I also develop my own perspective
22	I	I favor the former ; that is , I prefer to live in a higher pace condition .
22	B	The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks , and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam
22	I	I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place ; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test
22	I	Therefore , we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives .
22	B	Apart from the one I have mentioned above , another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy
22	I	If I can avoid being a sluggish person , I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully
22	I	For instance , I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition , defeating those spending less time on practicing
22	I	Hence , from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important .
22	B	Admittedly , on the other hand , there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed
22	I	However , from my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying
22	I	I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy
22	I	In contrast , it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment .
22	B	Based on the reasons demonstrated above , I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite
22	I	In other words , I prefer to live in high pace
22	I	It is not to say , of course that other points of view are totally without merit
22	I	Still , I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible .
23	B	The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations , and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change
23	I	Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources , I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children ' s acquisition of knowledge .
23	B	It is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students ' acquisition of knowledge
23	I	Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields , and as the students answer these questions , the facts has been learned and reinforced
23	I	A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams , as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time
23	I	Moreover , when students have some academic problems , they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs
23	I	Besides , in the past , conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves , now all can be done at a click of a button
23	I	Thus , technologies are vital in students ' learning .
23	B	On the other hand , schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators
23	I	At schools , students ' development has been orchestrated stage by stage , step by step by experienced teachers , and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way
23	I	Therefore , formal education approaches are also indispensable .
23	B	To put it all in a nutshell , I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children ' s development
23	I	So students should learn both from their teachers as well as modern technology to gain the best learning outcome .
24	B	Many animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons
24	I	While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species , others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention
24	I	In my opinion , we should give priority to our own issues .
24	B	Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem
24	I	If certain species are absent from this system , such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species , including human beings , will come under threat
24	I	Therefore , it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible .
24	B	However , I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution
24	I	The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being
24	I	A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment
24	I	On most occasions , the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it .
24	B	Furthermore , human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation , disease and wars
24	I	When these problems are taken into account , extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help
24	I	We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species .
24	B	In conclusion , more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals , and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction .
25	B	Along with the development of technologies , advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy
25	I	Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system , I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages .
25	B	The main advantage of high - tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health
25	I	They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity
25	I	In other words , they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost .
25	B	In addition , a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society
25	I	In facts , young people will be happy as their parents , grandparents are healthy
25	I	It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people .
25	B	On the other hand , some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system
25	I	Although it is real in some aspects , I believe that the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time , so they are worth to have good care
25	I	They have given their effort to the society so that young people , the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system .
25	B	By way of conclusion , it is true that the development of the health care system helps people have a better life
25	I	It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old .
26	B	There are many factors that contribute to one ' s success
26	I	However , which factor is the most influential one is open to debate
26	I	Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one ' s success
26	I	It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family
26	I	I agree with this statement
26	I	In my opinion , family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success
26	I	There are a couple of reasons .
26	B	First of all , more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university
26	I	Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did , they can provide more advices and helps in our career
26	I	In the past , seldom people have the chance to attend a collage
26	I	For example , my grandparents did not get a education even in high school , so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood , he had to go to his teacher for help
26	I	Things have changed a lot
26	I	I grow up in a better condition than my father did
26	I	Whenever I have problems , I can always ask my parents for help
26	I	They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot .
26	B	What is more , family members can help us in many other aspects
26	I	For example , when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university , my father told a lot about different majors
26	I	He shared his own experience with me , which helped me quite a lot
26	I	Parents are quite experienced than their child , they can guide them toward the right direction
26	I	Besides , parents can told their children as many as they can
26	I	What they want is help their child to make a progress .
26	B	In a word , our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life
26	I	I believe that with the help of our family , we can achieve success quite easily .
27	B	Many single people have difficulties deciding whether to live with a roommate or to live alone
27	I	Each makes different decisions
27	I	Some people choose to live alone for privacy , while others choose to live with a roommate for practical reasons
27	I	As far as I am concerned , I prefer to live with a roommate
27	I	This is because it saves me money , enables me to socialize , and allows me to get help .
27	B	Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money
27	I	If you have roommates , you can split the rent and utilities among them
27	I	This means you can get more for less
27	I	For example , last year , I shared a room off - campus with my friend , and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half : I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating , and two hundred dollars for rent monthly
27	I	I was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills .
27	B	Apart from saving a lot of money , living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily
27	I	It is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you
27	I	You can invite your roommates ' friends over to your room and have fun together
27	I	For instance , one night , my roommate , Millan , brought his friends along
27	I	Even though his friends and I were total strangers to each other , we quickly got to know each other
27	I	We soon found out that everyone loved playing video games
27	I	We played a video game called ' Halo ' together all night , and became good friends
27	I	Living with a roommate made socializing much easier for me .
27	B	Finally , living with a roommate allows me to get help
27	I	It often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need
27	I	When you run into a problem , you can ask your roommates if they can help
27	I	Some of them may have something to offer
27	I	To illustrate , when my computer mysteriously broke down , I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help
27	I	They failed to give me any useful solutions
27	I	To my surprise , one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help
27	I	He was very good with computers , and he managed to fix the problem quickly .
27	B	In conclusion , while many people decide to live alone for various reasons , I prefer to live with a roommate , and I always will
27	I	This is because it offers me many advantages , such as less spending , more socializing , and more help
27	I	I think single people should live with a roommate , if they want to enjoy their lives .
28	B	Generally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders
28	I	Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime
28	I	Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions , that forces to a person to be a criminal .
28	B	First of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime
28	I	Secondly , laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance  a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women , who steals for her drug addiction 
28	I	The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place .
28	B	On the contrary , fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government
28	I	Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal
28	I	Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other .
28	B	To conclude , Government should decide for punishment case by case basis
28	I	In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution .
29	B	There are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town
29	I	The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner , quieter and often friendlier place to live
29	I	However , despite the advantages of small town life , I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons .
29	B	On the one hand , I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area
29	I	To make it convenient , I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace
29	I	What ' s more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city .
29	B	On the other hand , life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town
29	I	You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities
29	I	For instance , you can visit museums to learn history , and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading , or you can go to a sports center for exercising
29	I	But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs .
29	B	Furthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation , like all kinds of information
29	I	If one can efficiently acquire the information , then , there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals
29	I	For example , there are various advertisements here an there , whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones
29	I	If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel , or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store , he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice .
29	B	There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring
29	I	Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government , which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers
29	I	Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high - quality education which is very important for their future development .
29	B	In conclusion , if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities , and have my children receive a better education , a big city is the place to live in .
30	B	Nowadays , many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities
30	I	Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field , the research takes up too much teaching time
30	I	As far as I am concerned , professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research .
30	B	To begin with , it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge
30	I	The professors ’ duty is to nurture students , and prepare excellent courses
30	I	If professors spend a lot of time on research , he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced , which may decrease the quality of classes
30	I	The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting - edged technologies
30	I	In this way , professors should provide well - preparation courses to convey the state - of - art knowledge for college and university students
30	I	Therefore , professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research .
30	B	On the other hand , if professors are busy in doing research , ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students , it would ruin the reputation of universities
30	I	Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course , and the enrollment of universities may decline
30	I	Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study
30	I	In this way , hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects
30	I	It is adverse to the whole academic field
30	I	Accordingly , spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors , rather than research .
30	B	Nevertheless , professors could teach students through research and projects
30	I	Some students enjoy taking part in some research
30	I	Through to use the equipment and invent their own work , they may get more experience in the process of research
30	I	For instance , electronic students always invent new machines such as robots , MP3 and remote control car
30	I	They can manage the electric theory in practical skills
30	I	And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions
30	I	However , only under specific circumstance , when students master all of the systematic knowledge , can they accomplish research
30	I	This is requires professors provide high quality courses
30	I	In other word , professor should concern about preparing class .
30	B	Consequently , conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent
30	I	However , the precondition of doing research is growing students ’ solid theory fundamental
30	I	Only by developing students , can we have a better academic field
30	I	Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way .
31	B	Many students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city
31	I	Both options have their advantages and disadvantages
31	I	After considering the level of freedom , the studying conditions and the economic factor , if I had to choose , I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories .
31	B	First , an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory
31	I	While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules , in the apartment you set your own rules
31	I	You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want
31	I	An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student
31	I	This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory .
31	B	Second , from an economic point of view , people often argue that an apartment is more expensive
31	I	This is only partially true , you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper
31	I	Transportation is another issue , you have to go to and return from the university everyday
31	I	You could choose to use public transportation , a cheaper option , or to have a car
31	I	The car is an expensive option , but also offers freedom of schedule and destination .
31	B	Lastly , the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don ' t have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories
31	I	A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times
31	I	Since in an apartment you don ' t have a roommate , you won ' t have this problem , and as a result you would be able to concentrate better
31	I	For the same reason , you won ' t have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music , bring friends over , or study late at night
31	I	You set your own schedules
31	I	In the other hand , living in a dormitory , and being surrounded by students also has some advantages , like being able to get help with any academic issues from them .
31	B	To conclude , both options have their advantages , but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory .
32	B	During our life , it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations ; therefore , groups and organizations are an important part of their lives
32	I	In my point of view , groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals
32	I	My reasons include the following :
32	B	In the first place , humans are a part of the society , and the society includes a wide variety of groups
32	I	Most of all , the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization , from children to adults
32	I	We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life , and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life
32	I	By making teamwork , the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others
32	I	As university students , it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others
32	I	After graduating from schools , employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits
32	I	Thus , almost of us live in the environment of groups .
32	B	By participating in an organization , it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose
32	I	A solid group can be a suited environment , which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons
32	I	For example , as a student majoring in mass media , I have taken part in mass media student group for a year
32	I	When being in the department of art , I have not only learned how to do a project , but also known some famous artists during the term
32	I	Above all , it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job .
32	B	Furthermore , groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal
32	I	Here is an example : there are various charities in the world
32	I	Tzu Chi , a non - profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan , is famous for contributing to the social and community services , and medical care
32	I	They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit
32	I	For accomplishing their missions , the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks
32	I	As a result , they lit the light for the poor and victims ; in addition , they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world .
32	B	For the above reasons and examples , it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds .
33	B	Some people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college
33	I	However , I believe that individuals should pay their college tuition because it would cost too much , the college education is a personal ' s choice , and there are many ways to fund a college education .
33	B	First , making college education free would cost too much
33	I	It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement , infrastructure and so forth
33	I	There are many other needs which should come first , such as providing health care to all American , or improving public schools
33	I	In addition , it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education
33	I	Consequently , it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds .
33	B	Second , it is a personal choice to go to a college
33	I	Not everyone wants to go to a college
33	I	People who want to make more money , and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education
33	I	Therefore , those people should make the financial investment in their own choice ; not the government .
33	B	Third , there are many ways to fund a college education
33	I	People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship , financial aids , and other funds
33	I	In addition , the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means
33	I	They often provide services such as fire departments , medical assistance , and police protection for the schools and their students
33	I	They also provide funds for academic research
33	I	While the money is not given to individual students , these contributions are not trivial .
33	B	In short , the individual should finance his or her education because it is a personal choice
33	I	Otherwise , it would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the government .
34	B	Although there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country , I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries .
34	B	Person ' A ' who learns a non - native language in his country may receive benefit from a step - by - step teaching method
34	I	In other words , he is not jumping into the foreign country
34	I	Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language
34	I	Besides , all the learners are probably from the same country , so all these people most likely have learned the language , more or less , in the same way .
34	B	On the other hand , when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken , he has the opportunity to communicate with natives
34	I	He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country
34	I	No doubt , it leads to better understanding of language essential skills
34	I	He also has access to the most up - to - date language
34	I	Thus he can learn most useful idioms , proverbs and so many other things which the former person , person ' A ', does not have access to .
34	B	On the whole , if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel , I would definitely make the second choice
34	I	There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language
34	I	When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language , you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible .
34	B	In a word , although each of these methods have their pros and cons , I am pretty sure that advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language .
35	B	Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man ' s life , people might have different preferences : some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends , while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends
35	I	In my view , I prefer the second attitude .
35	B	The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others ' experiences
35	I	For instance , among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport , or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before .
35	B	Of course , while differences give the opportunity to learn , they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement
35	I	This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends
35	I	In fact , in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same .
35	B	Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open - minded
35	I	For example , if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice , your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages .
35	B	When you have just few close friends , on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more , but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours , adding less to your experience .
35	B	In sum , although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points , I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one ' s life .
36	B	The development of public transportation is the most essential thing for a developed society
36	I	Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources , the air pollution , the loss of a sense of community
36	I	So , I think the government have to spend more money on improving it .
36	B	The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out
36	I	Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move
36	I	If people use too many private cars , the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly
36	I	Instead of using many private cars , people can use public transportation , such as bus , train , subway , each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person .
36	B	The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution
36	I	Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide , heat and so on
36	I	They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer
36	I	The more cars are driven , the more pollution will be put into air
36	I	If we use the public transportation , less cars will be used and less pollution will be emitted
36	I	The atmosphere , surrounding us , will be protected and help us more healthy .
36	B	The use of public transportation make us live more sociable
36	I	When we drive a private car , we are alone or only our family members that we already know and lost the opportunity to make friends with others or to see that we are a part of this society
36	I	When using public transportation , we have a chance to meet more people and more chances to discovery new aspects of life .
36	B	Using public transportation has a lot of advantages for the modern society facing a lot of problems : the environmental population , the isolation in life , the depletion of natural resources
36	I	So , the government have to invest more for it and encourage people to use .
37	B	Everyone has their method to success in life
37	I	At school or university , success depends on how we study
37	I	Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups
37	I	Yet , I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more , and it helps me to build my personality .
37	B	Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons
37	I	For instance , I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone
37	I	I can prepare my schedules , guidelines , exercises and go over them all
37	I	Moreover , we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math , reading , and drawing
37	I	In my opinion , I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone .
37	B	Additionally , we are building our personalities when we study alone
37	I	For example , answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent
37	I	Also , it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future
37	I	Personally , when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time , it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful .
37	B	To conclude , there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group
37	I	In fact , I agree with the idea of studying a lone since it helps me to focus more and establish my personality
37	I	Success needs us to work hard and sacrifice more whether we choose to study alone or with group .
38	B	At work , you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment
38	I	However , the relationship you need to maintain with your co - worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you , and in most instances you have to rely on him or her
38	I	Therefore in my view , a good co - worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation , trustworthiness , and fellowship .
38	B	The co - workers should be cooperative with one another
38	I	If they do not cooperate , there will be lots of disputes
38	I	I once had a co - worker who was too family conscious
38	I	Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not
38	I	Most of the time , I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person
38	I	However , one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor
38	I	When I requested my co - worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early , he turned down my request giving a silly excuse
38	I	From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility
38	I	Therefore , I believe if the co - workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment .
38	B	The co - workers need to trust each other
38	I	They should not act on suspicion
38	I	This is a very important aspect in the work environment
38	I	I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co - worker for carrying tales to me
38	I	To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co - worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him
38	I	However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co - worker gave up talking ill against him with me
38	I	But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department .
38	B	Finally , the co - workers should believe in fellowship
38	I	This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships
38	I	After all , you spend most of your day at office
38	I	If you have a good company in office , it is certainly a blessing .
39	B	During these digital age , the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society
39	I	Almost every school develops their online class systems
39	I	One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning
39	I	Although , online classes have many advantages , for me , I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons .
39	B	First , the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying
39	I	Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class
39	I	Consequently , the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate ' s ideas
39	I	Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends .
39	B	Second , classroom learning provides other activities than studying
39	I	During student ' s free time , they have a number of activities that they can join , such as playing sports , going to lab , or going to library
39	I	These activities lead to more interact with their friends
39	I	Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities , furthermore , they have a chance to learn about their societies
39	I	While the online course keeps the children at their home only .
39	B	Lastly , in school , there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice
39	I	The professor provides good answers to you
39	I	They do not mind helping you , and they never leave you alone when you got a problem
39	I	In contrast , in distance learning , these aspects of the professor had reduced their important
39	I	The professor has been assigned to teach only
39	I	Moreover , there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question .
39	B	In conclusion , traditional learning still has many benefits to the students
39	I	But in the future , it seems that the distance learning become more popular and ordinary in schools .
40	B	Students have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success
40	I	While some people believe that non - academic subjects should be completely removed , I strongly disagree with that .
40	B	To begin with , from the health point of view , schools should not only deliver academic subjects
40	I	If physical education is removed from the syllabus , there will be considerable negative effects on students ’ health
40	I	For instance , after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning , it is better for students to do some outdoor activities , such as stretching , jogging and playing ball games , in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes
40	I	Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people ’ s health , it will also decrease their learning capability .
40	B	In addition , schools are responsible for developing their students into well - rounded people
40	I	It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically
40	I	Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student , which requires more than academic knowledge , but also practical life skills such as cooking , good communication skills and teamwork spirit
40	I	Thus , school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life .
40	B	Some people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents
40	I	However , I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents
40	I	Moreover , parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills .
40	B	In conclusion , I strongly believe that non - academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student ’ s development
40	I	Therefore , schools should not remove these subjects .
41	B	When people move to another country , most likely , they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one
41	I	Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture , while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted
41	I	As for me , I would follow the new customs , if I migrated to another country .
41	B	On one hand , it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country , if they follow the new customs
41	I	When people migrate to a new country , they are likely to suffer the culture shock , because of the difference between two cultures
41	I	The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture
41	I	For example , if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer - than - usual , full - length Buddhist sutra in Buddha ' s Birthday in India , he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture
41	I	As a result , people understand the culture , and then they adapt to the new country .
41	B	On the other hand , keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination
41	I	When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one , they regard themselves as a special group in the new country
41	I	The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main - stream society
41	I	One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969
41	I	They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it
41	I	While the Indonesians stopped working at 4 : 00 pm and went home for rest , Chinese immigrants were still working
41	I	Although being much richer than local people , they faced the discrimination
41	I	Their houses and private cars were buried by local people , because the locals were jealous of Chinese people , who had so much wealth , which should have been theirs
41	I	If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia , they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated .
41	B	All in all , the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country , which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner , and assimilate to a new culture .
42	B	Everyone has happy moments during their life
42	I	These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood
42	I	In my opinion , childhood is the happiest time of a person ' s life .
42	B	First , in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood
42	I	They do not have to worry about bills , jobs , how would their life be in the future
42	I	They just worry about two things : to have fun , learn and be happy
42	I	A child ' s daily life is school , playing and sleeping
42	I	For example , when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood
42	I	Moreover , I did not have to worry about costs and other things , I just had fun and learned
42	I	Also , people are most creative when they were children , children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy .
42	B	Second , childhood is the period where people go to school and learn
42	I	Therefore , school memories are one of the best memories in a person ' s life
42	I	There you learn , to find your first love , to make new long - lasting friendships and of - course you will have a lot of fun
42	I	For example , my father ' s best moments in his life are in his school years
42	I	Moreover , he is still in - touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories .
42	B	In other words , childhood is , indeed , the most happiest moments in a person ' s life
42	I	There is only one life and one childhood and people should live their childhood thoroughly .
43	B	Learning to be independent is essential for young adults
43	I	However , how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue
43	I	In my point of view , staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult
43	I	My opinion is based on creating memories with parents , saving money , and taking advice from parents .
43	B	First of all , one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents
43	I	The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age
43	I	When having a job , it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown
43	I	If he lives with his parents for longer time , they have more chances to share the feelings , exercise , and travel together
43	I	All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by
43	I	Thus , I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile .
43	B	Furthermore , living at home costs less than living outside
43	I	Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home
43	I	Therefore , he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents
43	I	Moreover , another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings
43	I	Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be
43	I	In a word , the parents can save money , if their children live with them longer .
43	B	The third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother ' s suggestions
43	I	When in dilemma , the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand
43	I	They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way
43	I	If the parents do not help him immediately , he would have to suffer more pain
43	I	Hence , taking advice from parents , the young adult can go through obstacles easily .
43	B	To sum up , living with parents longer brings about memories with parents , less cost , and advice from parents
43	I	Hence , staying longer with parents is a better choice .
44	B	Some people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization , which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily
44	I	However , I do not agree with them
44	I	I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings
44	I	It is very crucial for learning
44	I	It helps animals out of extinction
44	I	Also , it is a interesting travel location .
44	B	First of all , the zoo gives humans new knowledge
44	I	When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals , what should you do if there were no zoo ? Inevitably , the zoo is the important place for innate learning
44	I	The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically
44	I	They are able to observe animals ' behaviors and features
44	I	Moreover , practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class
44	I	Besides , researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals .
44	B	Secondly , the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats
44	I	In the zoo , there is not so harmful as a forest
44	I	They , fed by zookeepers , do not need to find food themselves
44	I	Furthermore , we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife .
44	B	Last but not least , because of all weird , acute , and beautiful animals in the zoo , it can be a great tourist attraction
44	I	There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely
44	I	If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists , it will receive a great deal of money
44	I	That also make money flow , and then economics become better
44	I	It benefits to a certain country .
44	B	In conclusion , the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction , but also helps people around the world have better lives
44	I	I firmly believe that the zoo is so useful for the earth .
45	B	Space exploration , for discovery of out of space , has been possible for human in the 20th century
45	I	The United state and Russia are the important countries that spend large budgets for the research of this subject
45	I	In my opinion , spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future .
45	B	Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget , while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living
45	I	In 20th century , although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets , but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now
45	I	In during history , our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity
45	I	Therefore , it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets .
45	B	Space exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war
45	I	In the future , many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles
45	I	In the past , the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union
45	I	Both countries tried to send man to the moon and show their power to each other
45	I	As a result , space exploration will use as a military power for many countries .
45	B	In summary , spending budget for space exploring is not the waste budget , because it may helps to save civilization of humanity
45	I	Although exploring space used for discovery of other planets , nowadays most of governments have used many rockets for military purposes and therefore the purposes of exploring space has altered .
46	B	There is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship
46	I	It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result
46	I	However , I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend , although mistake is terrible
46	I	In this essay , I will present two reasons supporting my opinion .
46	B	First of all , a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever
46	I	Anybody does not remember mistakes
46	I	If someone remembers mistake , he or she has a closed mind
46	I	I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly
46	I	For example , my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift
46	I	However , I forgot about it just after two days , and I felt at peace with him
46	I	Some people might say I am silly , but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship .
46	B	Second , Everybody makes mistake
46	I	However , if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake , there will be no friends around you
46	I	I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake , we will need to end a friendship
46	I	However , when the mistake friend made was not a big problem , we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life
46	I	According to a research , 85 % of people answered that a best gift is a friend .
46	B	I think that a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big because friendship is forever and gift our life .
47	B	The issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams
47	I	This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it
47	I	However , I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge .
47	B	Firstly , standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students
47	I	For example some students are not so active on the lessons , cause they are already familiar with the issue
47	I	Therefore , exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students
47	I	In addition , many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class , so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them .
47	B	Additionally , standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice
47	I	Since , some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard , so they will never try to solve problems on their own
47	I	However , standardized tests offer them such chance
47	I	Thus , it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests , as long as this option helps to both sides .
47	B	Finally , I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice , since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students
47	I	In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance , so teachers could work with them more intensively
47	I	I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don ’ t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them .
47	B	Ultimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right
47	I	I belive this , due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students .
48	B	There is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success
48	I	For that reason , some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives
48	I	However , some people think it isn ' t supposed to be that case
48	I	From my point of view , I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path .
48	B	To start with , hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as , a shining weather , a delicious breakfast and etc
48	I	People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end
48	I	As a result , experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time .
48	B	What ' s more , people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles
48	I	Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties , they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens
48	I	Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way .
48	B	So , to sum it up , both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people ' s life path will be a priceless treasure to them
48	I	Remember if you are afraid of encountering difficulties , then you will be in the troubles all the time .
49	B	As far as I am concerned , I agree with the statement that life in a city is much better than life in the countryside .
49	B	Firstly , in the city there is much better education system
49	I	This means , that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places .
49	B	In addition , I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside
49	I	There are not only more jobs , but they are also well - paid
49	I	Of course living in a city is more expensive , but incomes are higher too .
49	B	Moreover , in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means , that the culture diversity is huge
49	I	Meeting and knowing new people ' s tradition is an unforgettable experience , which could influence on one ' s previous habits .
49	B	Furthermore , the city has well - organised lines of transport
49	I	The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside , so the city provides better communication .
49	B	However , in the countryside there are many places to rest , because of its location
49	I	Moreover , peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness .
49	B	Taking all into account , I think that living in the city is much better nowadays , because of the opportunities it gives
49	I	Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle , which for me is without perspective
49	I	If I could decide I would chose living in the city for sure .
50	B	Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day
50	I	Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much
50	I	Voice mail , e - mail , telephone or just traditional way : face - to - face
50	I	However , I prefer e - mail due to 3 reasons : convenience , honest expression and fluency in communicating .
50	B	Everyone agrees that e - mail has been a great way of communication
50	I	You can talk to others from thousands mile
50	I	For instance , if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth , no matter how far it is , you can keep contact
50	I	We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address
50	I	If the address is wrong , then you will know right away
50	I	Moreover , e - mail doesn ' t take too much time : just a click .
50	B	In addition , writing e - mail helps people express honestly
50	I	Some people think that the face - to - face conversations make them feel stupid
50	I	Sometimes , their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect
50	I	For instance , I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior , it ' s hard for me to face her and explain what she should do
50	I	Therefore , e - mail will be a good tool to help me speak out
50	I	She will just read my e - mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed
50	I	I don ' t have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive .
50	B	Last but not least , every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time
50	I	Voice email or face - to - face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident
50	I	For example , when I face my parents , I can ' t speak out every idea and express consecutively
50	I	They may stop me , speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say
50	I	Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation
50	I	E - mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive .
50	B	On the whole , to compare to all ways of communication , I really think that e - mail is the greatest way for major people to use
50	I	Its convenience saves our time
50	I	Additionally , honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can ' t be missing for a persuasive expression .
51	B	Although many people prefer communicating by telephone or face - to - face , personally I believe that communicating by e - mails or voice mails is better
51	I	There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay .
51	B	Firstly , communicating by e - mail is easy
51	I	Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with
51	I	In this case it is not so difficult to write an e - mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident .
51	B	Secondly , you can write an e - mail at any time of the day
51	I	As for me , I work and study at the university and I don ' t have spare time during the day
51	I	I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems
51	I	I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail .
51	B	Thirdly , when you write an e - mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself
51	I	For example , you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite
51	I	When you speak face - to - face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e - mail .
51	B	And finally , there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e - mail
51	I	You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business .
51	B	To sum up , I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible , but if this is an important and not urgent question I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail .
52	B	Every parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful
52	I	In order to achieve this , they start cultivating their children when they are very young
52	I	In addition to basic knowledge like language or science , music and art are usually on the must - learn list of the parents
52	I	In my opinion , I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them .
52	B	First , it ' s very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young
52	I	Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art - imagination
52	I	Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules
52	I	They are more abstract , requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched
52	I	Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances
52	I	Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies , music and art still bring out children ' s joy of flying in imagination .
52	B	Second , music and art are life - long cultivation worthy of investing
52	I	They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way
52	I	They are essential to our spiritual life
52	I	Therefore , even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists , learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure .
52	B	However , some people might argue that parents shouldn ' t put so much stress on children , since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them
52	I	In my opinion , it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like
52	I	If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer , that might be too much
52	I	In a child stage , music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills
52	I	In this way , it will not be such pressure on children .
52	B	In conclusion , young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage , but in every stage
52	I	Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his / her life .
53	B	Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not
53	I	Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen , the car use will decrease
53	I	While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life
53	I	Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason
53	I	But as far as I am concerned , I agree with the idea , which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future
53	I	The following reasons will present my points .
53	B	First of all , since the public transportation has improved , it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus
53	I	For example , I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn ' t have enough parking lots for the cars
53	I	So , with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own .
53	B	Second , a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world
53	I	So , with the risen of the aware to the environment , people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not
53	I	For example , instead of driving each one ' s car , if we put forty people in a bus , it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city .
53	B	Although , I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years
53	I	I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view
53	I	People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can ' t meet every place
53	I	Of course , it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places
53	I	However , no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on , it always have some other ways that you can do , you can ride a bike , or even walk on your feet
53	I	It not only helps you to reduce the car use , but also good to your health
53	I	In this way , this won ' t be a problem at all .
53	B	In conclusion , given the reasons described above , when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared , the best choice is obviously stand on my side , which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years .
54	B	Due to the convenience of current technology , people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them
54	I	People are no longer restricted in the office
54	I	This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it ' s better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company ' s office
54	I	In my opinion , I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office .
54	B	First of all , while working in the office , people can interact with their colleges instantly
54	I	They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together
54	I	Think about the big project that a group is working on , if any group member has new idea about the project , he / she can assemble his / her colleges right away and discuss
54	I	It ' s more efficient and straight - forward than talking in the phone
54	I	For another example , if one ’ s computer or Internet has any breakdown , he / she can call the MIS staff to fix .
54	B	Second , working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works
54	I	For example , people are easily distracted while working at home
54	I	It ' s hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away
54	I	In addition , while people are working at home , there will be no one supervising them , thus raises the chance of loafing
54	I	Moreover , people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office , like some announcements from the boss .
54	B	In conclusion , working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency
54	I	It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home .
55	B	I think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations
55	I	We should consider many factors and choose the best of them
55	I	I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons :
55	B	We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job
55	I	This can be done in school
55	I	In school , we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them
55	I	If we study them hard , we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future
55	I	For example , if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer , he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job
55	I	As you can see , studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job .
55	B	One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation
55	I	By relating well to people , we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication
55	I	Commuincation can bring many benefits
55	I	For example , if you need help with getting a job , by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well , you can achieve your goal
55	I	Or , if you are a salesman in a store or any other place , by relating well to your customers , you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers
55	I	So , relating well to people is also another important factor .
55	B	In sum , though some people may disagree with me , as I explained my reasons and examples above , none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits .
56	B	Advertising is becoming part of our modern society
56	I	They penetrate into people ' s life , affecting people ' s choices in different things
56	I	Therefore , it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people ' s life
56	I	Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits , while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people ' s judgments
56	I	In my opinion , the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits .
56	B	First of all , advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit
56	I	The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people ' s concept of wholesome diets and self - control
56	I	It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting , regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body
56	I	However , advertising is not the only information source for people
56	I	People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources , like news or magazines
56	I	As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits , they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations
56	I	It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast - food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors .
56	B	Second , in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle , some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods
56	I	In other words , advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people
56	I	Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added
56	I	These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good
56	I	In these cases , the advertising industry bolsters people ' s awareness of having a healthy lifestyle .
56	B	In conclusion , advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits
56	I	There are the build - up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self - control that really matter
56	I	Besides , advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle
56	I	It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away
56	I	We will always be able to decide our own lifestyles .
57	B	There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not
57	I	Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students , I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students ' future lives
57	I	In the following , I will state my reasons for this choice .
57	B	First , when students learn facts more in school , they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations
57	I	As a case in point , more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts
57	I	As a result , they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better .
57	B	Second , it would improve students ' social behavior
57	I	If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically , they would not realize human ' s mind very well
57	I	They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well
57	I	Thus , if they deal more with facts , they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life .
57	B	Moreover , these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts
57	I	As a matter of fact , when a student understands a fact and its consequences , he or she can encounter it more confidently
57	I	In my viewpoint , concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody ' s life
57	I	It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position .
57	B	All in all , I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above - mentioned reasons
57	I	Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc .
58	B	There are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes
58	I	It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities
58	I	Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges , I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students ' lives
58	I	In the following , I will state my reason for this choice .
58	B	First , besides the good body shape , sports have very vital effects on human ' s healthfulness
58	I	In my viewpoint , our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly
58	I	As a case in point , last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back
58	I	After that exam , I felt depressed and exhausted
58	I	Therefore , I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well ! As a result , sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health .
58	B	Second , besides the academic knowledge , the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human ' s life
58	I	As a practical epitome , students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation
58	I	Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other ' s mind and different environment
58	I	In my opinion , social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment
58	I	So , social activities have same rights to receive monetary support .
58	B	Moreover , they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments
58	I	If we follow just one wing of my life i
58	I	e ., studying as a student , after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn ' t have any motivation
58	I	Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends
58	I	In my perspective , more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me .
58	B	All in all , I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above - mentioned reasons
58	I	They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way .
59	B	Knowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time
59	I	Many people pursue to study foreign language
59	I	There are two options to learn foreign language
59	I	First is stay in homeland to study foreign language
59	I	The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken
59	I	Going to another place to learn language is better choice
59	I	I will give reasons to support my opinion .
59	B	To begin with , going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language
59	I	For example , everyone around me speaks foreign language , and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people
59	I	If I could not communicate with other people , I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger
59	I	This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language .
59	B	Secondly , having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster
59	I	For instance , English school in outside my home country , there are many people that come from different places and from different languages
59	I	The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language
59	I	Thus , I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong
59	I	This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster .
59	B	In conclusion , I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people
59	I	Besides , in foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends
59	I	Learning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language .
60	B	Getting opinions from many sources could augment people ' s performance
60	I	Thereby , evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system
60	I	Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students
60	I	Therefore , I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers .
60	B	To begin with , Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers ' performance
60	I	For example , evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product
60	I	Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information
60	I	Consequently , teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give
60	I	Therefore , evaluating from students could improve teachers ' performance .
60	B	Additionally , this evaluation from students could improve schools ' quality
60	I	Teachers could augment their quality
60	I	Consequently , When school gather teachers that have great performance , school are gaining higher quality
60	I	For instance , in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high
60	I	Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students .
60	B	Finally , people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students
60	I	Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance
60	I	Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects , students could comprehend their subject easily
60	I	As a result , students , who study from great schools which have great performance teacher , graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life .
60	B	In conclusion , I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance
60	I	Moreover , schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers
60	I	Furthermore , students are easy to understand their subjects
60	I	Thus , I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers .
61	B	 Keep running !, shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move
61	I	During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014 , I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute
61	I	At some moment , my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary
61	I	I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty
61	I	From this experience , I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals .
61	B	Firstly , committing to our goal helps creating personal worth
61	I	For example , I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard
61	I	Even if I were not to win this medal , I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running .
61	B	Secondly , one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger
61	I	I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line
61	I	However , I did not give up , and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself
61	I	I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning , and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger .
61	B	Thirdly , at some point , we , as an average people , might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on
61	I	I believe that the responsibility is worthy of carrying
61	I	When the distance is longer and harder to achieve , a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself
61	I	He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal .
61	B	For these reasons , I agree that one should not give up , as the true reward is to have the dignity
61	I	Anyone who wants to achieve the goal should acknowledge that his effort and experience from suffering helps him understand his true potential and increase his strength , and ultimately , it will prompt him to be ready for overcoming the greater challenge in his life .
62	B	Believe it or not , nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not , thus making them confused
62	I	Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier
62	I	Although I conceded technology may make people ' s life complicated in some aspects , the convenience it brings is more
62	I	In what follows , I will illustrate my point of view .
62	B	First , when it comes to the field of transportation , there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people ' s life simpler
62	I	With a private car , you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle
62	I	Alternatively , if you would like to have a trip across the ocean , a plane can carry you there in only a few hours , which is hard to imagine in the ancient times .
62	B	Second , technology also makes teaching simpler
62	I	In the past , teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard , resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers
62	I	With the advent of iPads in e - learning , paper books become unnecessary , so does the blackboards , it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads , with a single click , and they would appear right before your eyes at once .
62	B	Admittedly , to some extent , technology may make people ' s life more complicated
62	I	For example , the cell phone , which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance , now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications
62	I	For instance , folks have to check their Facebooks , Twitters , and Forums accounts every minute , which add too much pressure to them
62	I	In addition , games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers , leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones
62	I	Consequently , making their life more complicated and tired .
62	B	Based on the factors I have mentioned above , a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people ' s life complicated in some cases , the convenience it brings in people ' s are significant .
63	B	Organizations , these days , seek to find people who can work extraordinary fast and carefully
63	I	These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company
63	I	Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal mentioned before
63	I	I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons
63	I	Trying to learn skills , working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice .
63	B	To begin with , if persons work rapidly , they will have more chance to study
63	I	Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter
63	I	If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying , they can stares in their workplace
63	I	For example , I have a friend who was working so slowly
63	I	He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him
63	I	My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working .
63	B	Most importantly , people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased
63	I	If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money
63	I	This fact pushes them to work faster and faster
63	I	For example , because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money , I am working in two organization to gain more salary
63	I	The more money , the more chances .
63	B	Last but not least , people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks
63	I	If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly , your boss will assign you more tasks
63	I	If you do them fast too , the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder
63	I	It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation
63	I	Even if we ignore this result , by the same token , you can get higher position and more money .
63	B	To sum up , I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky
63	I	Gaining more skills by study , having more than one job , and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages
63	I	I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice .
64	B	The housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays
64	I	And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years
64	I	The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important
64	I	What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction .
64	B	Building more accommodating constructions meets people ' s basic need
64	I	People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in
64	I	If the price of housing grows continuously , a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class
64	I	Then , ordinary people , especially the younger generation , will fall into a certain pattern - work , pay bills for housing , work ; and I am sure that it will increase people ' s dissatisfaction of the government
64	I	Because when they are working , the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers , which will limit their efficiency
64	I	And government should spend money on people to rescue them from this , because only a government of the people , by the people , for the people will finally last ; people ' s cohesiveness will be promoted .
64	B	Otherwise , another vital reason why new building construction deserves more governmental investment lies in the fact that it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation
64	I	Build a new building has following prerequisites , land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures , a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor
64	I	Except these , hundreds of problems would occur during the construction
64	I	Thus , only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness .
64	B	Generally , personally speaking , I believe new building construction hold the right to gain more money from government .
65	B	It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones , but these revolutions should not include historic buildings
65	I	The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors
65	I	In addition , they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists .
65	B	Historic buildings answer many questions , which are mysterious about our previous ancestors ; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings
65	I	They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city
65	I	They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago
65	I	They show us how they survive , or how they defend themselves etc
65	I	By investigating about their structures , we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building
65	I	In the other hand , historic buildings are important treasures , which provide an area to learn valuable lessons .
65	B	Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city
65	I	It is interesting for most people to know about the way people live in thousands years ago
65	I	Therefore , It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors
65	I	Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on .
65	B	These are reasons that why we should preserve historic buildings in the city
65	I	They can benefit us financially by developing other industries
65	I	Moreover , they are the symbols of our nations , which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors .
66	B	Women or men almost need each other in full of life even in school
66	I	Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education , others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender
66	I	In my opinion , boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex .
66	B	School is a small society for students , which prepares them for the future life
66	I	By attending to the same school , students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate
66	I	In addition , a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa
66	I	They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study , how communicate with girls in a group , etc
66	I	Admittedly , when they study together and help each other , they exercise the the real life as they age
66	I	By contrast , some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them
66	I	By doing this , outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship and as result , their thoughts deviate from the studies .
66	B	Moreover , attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better
66	I	Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class , therefore they will study increasingly
66	I	Indeed , Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa
66	I	As a result , the productivity of the class will be increased .
66	B	In a word , attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages
66	I	Taking part in the study groups would increase student ' s motivation to study more
66	I	In addition , they would be able to know the opposite gender , which help them to be prepared for the adult life where they almost will live or work together .
67	B	The city where I was born used to be of a great antique beauty , which was surrounded with by lots of ancient style buildings
67	I	Unfortunately , the unstoppable trend of urbanization makes me only appreciate parts of those classic buildings in the pictures or in museums
67	I	In order to prevent the disappearance of the historic buildings , some citizens suggest the government to spend money on historic buildings
67	I	As far as I am concerned , we should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings , letting next generations still have a chance to look at them
67	I	Here are some reasons and examples to illustrate my viewpoint .
67	B	Historic buildings have intrinsic values , because they are significant symbols of a city
67	I	Old buildings are reminders of a city ' s culture and complexity
67	I	By seeing historic buildings -- whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic , people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area
67	I	For example , when somebody mentions Beijing , China ' s capital city , you will immediately have Capital Palace come to appear in your mind , because it is the most remarkable sign of the city , and also it is the inevitable history of Beijing , even the entire China
67	I	Depending on the study of Capital Palace , researchers have a comprehensive understanding of the history and the culture .
67	B	Furthermore , historic buildings make our lives more colorful , provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds
67	I	The city is occupied with an abundance of modern houses and and high buildings which make it crowded , and no rooms for people to relax themselves
67	I	However , the warmth of the materials , the heart pine , marble , or the old brick , all those old buildings features call back of our inner peace
67	I	Lying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life ' s little annoyance and feel peaceful .
67	B	Meanwhile , historic buildings can be a source of maintenance fees
67	I	There are many historic buildings , such as Beijing Place , Shanghai Artist Museum , they are all able to support themselves financially by charging tens of thousands of tourists
67	I	Our governments will be happy with those efficient consequences , and a majority of cities also can imitate this economical cycle .
67	B	Overall , I believe that the city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity
67	I	However , the preservation of old buildings is a one - way street
67	I	There is no chance to renovate to save a history site once it ' s gone
67	I	This reality brings us to light the importance of locating and saving old buildings of historic significance
67	I	Therefore , government should spend money on preservation of old buildings .
68	O	Decade after decade , every day , scientists discover magnificent devices in the field of IT , such as interactive boards , multicore computers and laptops , tablets , which have an incredible resolution and also mobile phones , which have the power of a computer
68	O	World Wide Web and communication via email are some of the positive sides of information technology , however , there are some negative aspects .
68	B	Firstly , connecting people by email is easy and fast
68	I	In addition , World Wide Web offers humanity to access to information , which they want to know for less than 10 seconds
68	I	These are two of the benefits , why IT is useful .
68	B	Besides , nowadays technology is entering into our society really quick and scientists develop robots , which help people cope with their problems or just invent coffee machines , engines with integrated computers and etc
68	I	For example , before centeries , there were not washing machines , which clean your clothes , while a person do another job .
68	B	Secondly , there are some drawbacks about this issue
68	I	Scientists believe that one day people will face their developments , for instance robots , and they will not succeed to control them
68	I	All this inventions will try to take control of the Earth .
68	B	In conclusion , I agree that IT discoveries are likely to have more disadvantages than benefits and people should know how to use their developments properly .
69	B	With the development of technology , whether or not it is still necessary to protect the traditional skills and lifestyles leads to a drastic controversy which is becoming a public concern , especially considering the significant impact taken by technology
69	I	As far as I am concerned , the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to .
69	B	Traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society , in terms of healthcare , environmental protection and cultural inherit
69	I	Although technology takes convenience to humankind , it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life , like sedentary lifestyle
69	I	Instead , traditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance
69	I	Meanwhile , due to the fact that traditional skills rely little on fossil energy , it is more environmentally - friendly , which should be promoted to reduce the threat of climate change
69	I	Furthermore those tradition - related things convey traditional culture and values
69	I	These are important foundation of modern civilization
69	I	Protection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems .
69	B	Some people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes
69	I	In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance , it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions
69	I	Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life , so as to make people to realize the value of them .
69	B	All in all , protection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently , but also contributes to the next generation .
70	O	Paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country
70	O	Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that
70	O	Personally , I tend to disagree with this view .
70	B	To start with , all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government , as it is the most important source of government ' s revenue , which is mainly used to serve all citizens
70	I	For example , a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability , so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment
70	I	The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors , such as teachers and police officers
70	I	Although these workers do not produce profit directly , what they do is for the well - being of the whole society .
70	B	However , I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax
70	I	As we know , there are impoverished or disabled people in every society , needing help and support from others
70	I	It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties , but such financial help is usually far from enough
70	I	In such case , aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial , which are a great complement to government support
70	I	Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force
70	I	There are criminals in every society , and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited
70	I	So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities , by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department .
70	B	In conclusion , it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government
70	I	Other than that , they have other critical obligations to take , in order to make our society function in an ordered way .
71	B	In today ' s world , computer is an essential part of everyday life
71	I	Around the globe , the effect is evident on children also
71	I	It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis
71	I	This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers .
71	B	The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text , image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about
71	I	As an example , students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter
71	I	It ' s hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers
71	I	That is how , computer impacts children on a positive note .
71	B	Nowadays , computers enable people to prepare presentations , draw complex graphs and pictures , document thesis in a simple though efficient way
71	I	When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age , they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world
71	I	For instance , students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects , get an edge over others at an early stage of their career
71	I	From this , it ' s clear that computer has a positive effect on the children .
71	B	Following the demonstration of a computer ' s contribution in children ' s study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards , it is agreed that computer is a boon to children
71	I	However , parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don ' t get misled .
72	B	Educational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children
72	I	Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre - school
72	I	However , those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years
72	I	This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children ' s learning
72	I	I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten .
72	B	To begin with , children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years
72	I	Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to
72	I	Moreover , teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning
72	I	Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well - trained in the use of this specific language , so quality education will be delivered .
72	B	Nevertheless , it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners , and the best time to hone them is in their younger years
72	I	The introduction of foreign language will be new to them ; however , their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend
72	I	In this way , grasping a new language will be natural to them
72	I	In addition , the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers
72	I	Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years
72	I	It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages .
72	B	In conclusion , the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people ; however , there are those who disagree
72	I	I am totally convinced that if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools , this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children .
73	B	I agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture , because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates .
73	B	There is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area
73	I	Firstly , some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions
73	I	Therefore , those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment
73	I	Moreover , tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background
73	I	For example , Indians don ' t eat beef since they worship cows
73	I	Thus , if tourists want to respect the tradition , they will not order any beef in the local restaurant .
73	B	On the other hand , in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals , people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions
73	I	For instance , tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place
73	I	Furthermore , the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries
73	I	Thus , the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties .
73	B	Obviously , people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism
73	I	Hence , I think international tourism leads to both tension and understanding between people from different culture .
74	O	These days , most of countries on the world invest for technology
74	O	It is evident that technology promotes economy
74	O	Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated
74	O	I totally disagree this opinion .
74	B	First of all , traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture
74	I	They make differences between countries
74	I	Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation , intelligence
74	I	Consequently , people feel pround of their country , so they keep reserving conventions
74	I	For example , ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries .
74	B	In addition , in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology
74	I	Lot of people like to use traditional things because if their quality and durability
74	I	In paticular , vases are made by hand would be used more
74	I	Futhermore , there are plenty of works that using traditional way is unique method
74	I	For instance , making cone hats from leaves have to use hand
74	I	Not only because there is no machine for the work , but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand , so resulting in greater value economy .
74	B	The last thing is about education
74	I	Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history
74	I	Methods which their ancestors used in the past will be displayed again for new generations
74	I	After that , they might create somethings that are useful for life .
74	B	In conclusion , technology has brought many benefits , but traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever .
75	B	 Capital punishment or the death penalty is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime
75	I	In recently years , many countries have polished the law of the death penalty
75	I	In the whole world , 51 % countries have polished death penalty ; even , it is at 98 % in Europe
75	I	Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase
75	I	However , others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty
75	I	Personally , I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons .
75	B	Firstly , capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture
75	I	Crimes kill someone which is illegal ; nevertheless , the government use law to punish them , which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one
75	I	As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time ; also , it is regarded as the  legalized revenge  to victims ' family
75	I	Hence , death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture .
75	B	Secondly , nobody has the right to take another human life
75	I	It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being
75	I	No one has the right to take the life of a human ; even if he committed murder
75	I	If you kill a criminal , you become a criminal
75	I	Moreover , if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem , it is neither unethical nor immoral
75	I	In short , crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment .
75	B	Finally , with some of serious criminals , capital punishment is an easy way out
75	I	Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds
75	I	If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins , it is so easy for them
75	I	They do not undergo any pain or misery
75	I	Why do not we have other wisely punishments ? As we can see some industries such as mining , oil and gas extraction , reclamation , etc , needs many labors
75	I	Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country - it is better
75	I	Moreover , rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts .
75	B	To conclude , capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge , it is an easy way for serious crimes , and nobody has rights to take others life ; thus , it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society
75	I	The world should consider clearly about polishing the law of the dead penalty .
76	B	Nowadays , technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life
76	I	In education , it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances
76	I	From my viewpoint , the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students ' progress .
76	B	To start with , since technology was introduced , student have been exposed to a wide range of information , which neccessarily broaden their minds
76	I	The internet , for example , provide knowledge in the form of news , radio talks , tapes or reseachs on any particular fields
76	I	There , the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide .
76	B	Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning
76	I	The modern world provides learners with the mp3 , the mobile phone or the laptop that help them , especially language learners , listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime
76	I	Therefore , students will develop their skills at a greater pace
76	I	Moreover , the internet again , is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids , such as educational games , sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly .
76	B	On balance , I have to consent to the use of technology in education , as it expedites data availability and accelarates students ' learning process
76	I	It is highly recommended that apart from education , technology should be applied in every aspect of life which assures of a better future .
77	B	It goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted
77	I	Their success should be attributed to many different external factors
77	I	It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments
77	I	However , in my opinion , the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements .
77	B	To begin with , the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children
77	I	In high school , for instance , an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same
77	I	From a psychological perspective , the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children , which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children ' s academic performances .
77	B	To add up , when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such , classmates are second to none
77	I	It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents , explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others ; it can be , for example , lessons on the class , social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents
77	I	Sharing the same age , children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas , to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments , resulting in deeper comprehension .
77	B	All advantages considered , classmates are unrivalled by the children ' s parents as they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion , two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school .
78	B	Nowadays , the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes
78	I	Personally , I believe such details should be strictly censored , if not banned altogether .
78	B	It is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating
78	I	These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is , more often than that , to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings
78	I	Consequently , a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased , exaggerated or fraudulent , which only result to terrorize communities and leave law - aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes .
78	B	An even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials , which would be hard to obtain otherwise
78	I	This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans , avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police
78	I	Thus , without the prevention on criminal details , the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken .
78	B	Most importantly , particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced
78	I	Without their consent , this could only add to theses innocent people ' s mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions .
78	B	In conclusion , I strongly hold my point that any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer , as they may be false , may further drive up the already - high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes .
79	B	There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty
79	I	Personally , I do not agree the viewpoint , because many different characters exist between male and female students .
79	B	On one hand , boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality
79	I	Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act , and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases
79	I	For instance , there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world
79	I	Many boys are interested in science and technology , while a number of girls like to learn literature , education and arts
79	I	Besides , girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication , such as teacher , singer and interpreter
79	I	This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent , and they both have better ability in the specific aspect .
79	B	Furthermore , it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender , and that does not conform to students ' personality traits and mental development
79	I	For example , a girl , who is interested in literature , is arranged into an engineering department , but she is unlikely to focus on her subject , and this also can block the girl ' s future development and career prospect .
79	B	On the other hand , universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities , and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects
79	I	It would affect students ' mental health to study in the environment of single gender .
79	B	In conclusion , it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls , and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject .
